- **Code Generator**: Converts the modified AST back into code, completing the process.
- **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: Helps you see how Babel uses the AST to make changes to your code.
- **Config Files**: Shows how to read config files like `.babelrc` to fit your specific needs.
- **Traverser**: Walks through the AST nodes, allowing specific changes based on what it finds.
